          <dt>Am I really going to be "locked" in a room?</dt>
          <dd>
            No, the door you came in is unlocked the entire game. Should you
            feel the need to leave the room, you are welcome to do so at any
            time.

            Bad news....you won’t get rich at this job. The pay starts at $10 an
            hour and you are paid weekly via direct deposit. At the end of 90
            days you will receive a pay raise. It can be some extra spending
            money, for sure. However, if you are seeking a job to support a
            household then this is no longer the ”coolest” part time job ever,
            it is now the “worst” part time job ever. There is opportunity for
            advancement for sure and raises however, this job is not about that.
